# Embedded Universal DSL: a good DSL for us, by us

This repository contains the source code for `EUDSL`, a toolkit for the construction of 
embedded DSLs, in arbitrary languages, for targeting [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org).

FYI: this project is currently "alpha" quality.

Currently, there are three components:

1. [eudsl-tblgen](./projects/eudsl-tblgen): Python bindings to [LLVM's TableGen library](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/659192b1843c4af180700783caca4cdc7afa3eab/llvm/lib/TableGen);
2. [eudsl-nbgen](./projects/eudsl-nbgen): A source-to-source translator that translates MLIR headers[^1] into direct `nanobind` bindings;
3. [eudsl-py](./projects/eudsl-py): Direct Python bindings to MLIR, generated using `eudsl-nbgen`;
   * Currently only TableGen outputs (various `*.h.inc` files generated by `mlir-tblgen`) are automatically translated but the `eudsl-nbgen` tool can be manually run to translate any MLIR header (to varying degrees of success);
   * See [projects/eudsl-py/tests](./projects/eudsl-py/tests) for a few examples of what these bindings look like.

## Getting started

Python wheels of all the tools are available at the [`latest` release page](https://github.com/llvm/eudsl/releases/tag/eudsl).
They are also `pip install`-able with .e.g

```shell
$ cd <EUDSL_CHECKOUT_DIR>
$ pip install eudsl-py -f https://llvm.github.io/eudsl
```

`eudsl-py` has a slowly growing set of tests @ [projects/eudsl-py/tests](./projects/eudsl-py/tests).

If you don't want to install locally, here is a [colab notebook minimal working example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l-6rVnsUM3ypn7rKcaF_V6XVdopEM4Df?usp=sharing).

## Developing/building

**Strong recommendation**: check the CI scripts @ [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) - they do a fresh checkout and build on every commit and are written to be read by a non-CI expert.

Firstly, you need a distribution of LLVM. You can build LLVM from source using our submodule by doing (on Mac/Linux or mingw):

```shell
$ cd <EUDSL_CHECKOUT_DIR>
$ ./build_tools/build_llvm.sh
```

Alternatively you can download a distribution for your platform from the [`llvm` release page](https://github.com/llvm/eudsl/releases/tag/llvm).

Then each of the above tools can both be built as a conventional, standalone, CMake project and as a Python wheel.
The wheel build looks something like:

```shell
$ cd <EUDSL_CHECKOUT_DIR>
$ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/llvm-install 
$ pip wheel projects/eudsl-nbgen -w wheelhouse -v
$ pip wheel projects/eudsl-py -w wheelhouse -v --find-links $PWD/wheelhouse
```

Note, the trailing `--find-links $PWD/wheelhouse` on `pip wheel projects/eudsl-py` is because `eudsl-nbgen` is a dependency of `eudsl-py` (that can be satisfied using the `eudsl-nbgen` wheel).

If you want to build an individual tool via CMake you can do something like:

```shell
$ cd <EUDSL_CHECKOUT_DIR>
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PWD/llvm-install 
$ cmake -B $PWD/eudsl-nbgen-build -S $PWD/projects/eudsl-nbgen -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/eudsl-nbgen-install
$ cmake --build "$PWD/eudsl-build" --target install
```

If you want to build all the tools at once using CMake you can use the root [`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt).
Note, in this case, `eudsl-nbgen` will automatically be built prior to `eudsl-py`.
